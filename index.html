    <h2 class="list_title">About me</h2>
    <p class="body">Born in Tychy, Poland in 2008 and moved to the USA. I am a junior at Wake Early College 
        of Biotechnology and Engineering. I am very interested in cars, aircraft, and heavy machinery. 
        I enjoy drawing, working on cars, and going to the gym. I swim and do some martial arts
        on the side. I also work as a lifeguard at a Lifetime club.
    </p>
    <p class="body">I originaly got sucked into cars because of my dad who shares the same interest. I 
        have since been able to begin working towards increasing my knowledge in that field.
        I have done a number of aftermarket modifications to my dads Subaru WRX as well as my
        Ram 1500. I plan to buy a project Ram 2500 as a project truck to continue my work in this
        field.
    </p>
    <p class="body">I plan to continue my education in the computer field hopefully getting a degree, 
        however I feel that I would like to try to become a pilot in the Coastguard. I have always 
        found aircraft facinating and have had them in the back of my mind as a career choice.
        Becoming a Coastguard pilot would also allow me to continue my career in civilian aviation
        once I am out.
